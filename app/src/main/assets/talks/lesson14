This is the end of my nonsense lesson series! Why don't you create one of your own now. 

Just add lesson(number) files under "talks/" in assets for texts.

If your lesson contains code snippets:
-Create a file with the name "lesson(number)" under "codes/" in assets
-Add these file extensions to the created file 

- .java (for java codes)
- .xml (for xml files)
- no extension for (AndroidManifest.xml codes)
